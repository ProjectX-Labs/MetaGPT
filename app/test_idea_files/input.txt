This frontend project is to create a chatbot platform named ProjectX, designed to consult with the user to understand what they want to build, then using the conversation on the objective. During the conversation, the ai agent chatbot will generate requirements, and then at the end of the conversation when the user clicks complete, the agent will generate a detaile consultation document covering all the techincal and non-techincal details, including the generated requirements appended to the end.

The user will also login with github oauth, where that info will be saved to the backenddb.

The technical stack: The frontend stack of ProjectX will be need to be developed using NextJS 14, MongoDB (with mongoose), LangChain JS, and OpenAI's api with GPT-4. The user interface and experience will be similar to that of ChatGPT. This means users can have conversations with the platform, much like they would with ChatGPT.
