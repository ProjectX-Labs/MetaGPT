The project is to create a chatbot platform named ProjectX, designed to help users with coding and questions based in a specific framework, and related to their startup. This platform will index the documentation content from the most popular frontend and backend frameworks. These frameworks are the ones users typically use to build their projects. The content will be from the most stable versions of these frameworks. The unique feature of ProjectX is that it will have specific agents trained on individual frameworks. Users can interact with these agents to generate high-quality, reliable code and ask questions related to that specific framework.

The backend of ProjectX will be developed using FastAPI, Motor, MongoDB, LangChain, and OpenAI's GPT-4 technology. The user interface and experience will be similar to that of ChatGPT. This means users can have conversations with the platform, much like they would with ChatGPT. However, the difference is in the specialization. For example, if a user is working on a startup and needs help with Next.js, they can interact with the Next.js agent in ProjectX. This agent will be specifically trained and knowledgeable about Next.js.

ProjectX is designed to remember information about the user's startup and what they are building. This allows for ongoing, specific conversations with an agent tailored to a particular framework of the user's application. The service can operate by indexing the documentation of these frameworks and training the chat agents with this data. Alternatively, the agent can be provided with a default document URL to refer to for researching a specific framework during the course of a conversation. This approach aims to provide targeted, framework-specific assistance for users working on various coding projects.
