# Technical Specification Document for Big Data Assignment

## Objective

The primary objective of this assignment is to develop a PySpark program that trains a Ridge Regression model using the Spark MLlib and performs predictions on a specified example. The output should include the model's weights and intercept. This document outlines the specifications and requirements for the assignment.

## File Specification

- **File Name**: The entire program should be contained within a single file named `a3.txt`.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Data Input

- **Format**: The training dataset is in LibSVM format.
- **Source**: The path to the training data will be specified in the script. It must be adaptable to different datasets in the same format.

### 2. Model Training

- **Algorithm**: Ridge Regression.
- **Library**: Apache Spark's MLlib.
- **Iterations**: The model should be trained for 100 iterations.
- **Regularization Parameter**: Set the regularization parameter to 0.5.
- **Intercept**: The model must be trained with an intercept.

### 3. Model Output

- **Weights**: Print out the weights of the trained model.
- **Intercept**: Print out the intercept of the trained model.

### 4. Prediction

- **Test Example**: Predict on the following example: “1:32.9 2:74 3:257.50 4:70.00 5:40.8 6:132.4 7:108.5 8:107.1 9:59.3 10:42.2 11:24.6 12:35.7 13:30.0 14:25.9”.
- **Result**: Display the prediction result for the provided example.

## Technical Requirements

1. **PySpark**: The program must be written using the PySpark API.
2. **Spark MLlib**: Utilize Spark MLlib for the Ridge Regression algorithm.
3. **Python Version**: Ensure compatibility with the latest stable Python version.
4. **Spark Version**: Ensure compatibility with the latest stable Apache Spark version.

## Execution Environment

- The program should be executable in a standard Spark environment.
- It should be platform-independent, capable of running on any operating system that supports Python and Apache Spark.

## Testing and Validation

- Validate the program by training the model on the provided dataset and ensuring it outputs the correct weights and intercept.
- Test the prediction functionality using the specified example and verify the output.

## Deliverable

- A single file named `a3.txt` containing the complete PySpark program as per the above specifications.


- Ensure the code is well-commented to explain key sections and logic.
- Follow practices for coding in Python and using PySpark.
